# Frontend For Group Buying Website



## Group Delivering & Buying Platform
### Overview

This project is an innovative platform aimed at enabling group buying and delivery within a single country or city, leveraging economies of scale to reduce the cost per product for users. Inspired by the success of Pinduoduo, this platform focuses on bringing together consumers to collectively purchase and receive goods at a significantly reduced cost.

## Features
### Group Buying:
Users can create or join groups to collectively purchase items.
Group organizers set the target number of participants needed to secure a group discount.
Once the threshold is met, the purchase is made at the discounted rate for all participants.
### Group Delivery:
Utilizes a centralized delivery system to consolidate multiple orders heading to similar locations.
Reduces delivery costs by optimizing routes and volume-based shipping discounts.
Provides real-time tracking for users to monitor the status of their deliveries.
### Economies of Scale:
By aggregating orders, the platform negotiates bulk discounts from suppliers.
Lower per-unit costs are passed on to users participating in the group purchase.
### User Interaction:
User-friendly interface for creating, managing, and joining buying groups.
Secure payment gateways integrated to facilitate transactions.
Personalized profiles for tracking order history and managing deliveries.
